# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

Examples:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.

Examples:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Association Rules

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

## Key Concepts

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers
- **Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data

### Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques.

## Applications
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Fraud Detection
- Medical Diagnosis
- Autonomous Vehicles
